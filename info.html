                        The person responsible for the hoards of Catan loyalists is Klaus Teuber. 
                        Teuber is the creator of The Settlers of Catan, a board game where players compete
                        to establish the most successful colony in the fictional island of Catan. 
                        Since its inception in Germany 1995, Catan has sold more than 18 million copies worldwide.

                        Before Catan's success, Teuber was working as a dental technician outside the industrial city
                        of Darmstadt, Germany. He was unhappy with his current occupation at the time and started creating
                        board games in his basement as a form of escapism.<br><br>

                        -Klaus Teuber <br><br>

                        In 1998, Teuber left his job in in the dental lab as he felt Catan was sufficient enought to support 
                        him and his family. In 2002, he made it into a family business. Teuber's sons, Guido and Benjamin are now included as managing
                        directors. Guido focusses on the English-speaking market and Benjamin primarily focuses on the international game development. 

                        Today, Catan is now available in over 40 languages. According to the official Catan website, approximately 20 million people regularly spend time in 
                        the Catan gaming universe.

                        Each player chooses a color and takes its corresponding pieces: 5 settlements, 4 cities, 15 roads.
                        Every player places two settlements and two roads on the board. Catan has three main gameplay components:
                        producing resources, trading resources, and using those resources to build things. <br><br>

                        To produce resources, each player rolls two dice. If any player has a settlement adjacent to a tile marked with 
                        a token that matches the total dice roll. Players receive one resource card for each adjacent settlement.<br><br>

                        To trade resouces with other players, talk with fellow players to see if anyone would like to make a deal. Perhaps, 
                        someone would like to trade a Sheep for Wood? If other players would not like to partake in a trade, players can always
                        trade four of any one resource for a single card. During a player's turn, other players can negotiate with 
                        the player who's turn it is. However, they cannot negotiate with each other until it is their turn.<br><br>

                        To determine what it costs to build look at the construction costs reference card. For example, to build a road it would take
                        1 brick and 1 wood. A player can build as many items as they want during their turn provided they have enough resources.<br><br>

                        The first player to reach 10 Victory Points wins. There are several different ways to gain Victory Points:<br><br>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Building Settlements</li>
                            <li>Upgrading Settlements to Cities</li>
                            <li>Building the longest road of at least five segments</li>
                            <li>Raising the largest army of at least three Knight cards</li>
                            <li>Holding Victory Point Cards in your hand</li>
                        </ol><br>

                <h2 id="strategies">Best Winning Strategies</h2><br>
                <p id="strat">
                    
                    <b>Strategy 1 - Pick Brick and Wood:</b>Brick and wood are the most importan resources on the board.
                    It is important to keep this in mind when picking where to place your settlements. Having an 
                    abundance of each item can be advantageous for building cities but also for negotiationg among
                    other players. <br><br>

                    <b>Strategy 2 - Count the dots: </b>Count the dots: If you are unsure where to place your next settlement, count the
                    number of dots beneath the numbers on the tiles. The sum of the surrounding dots is the total 
                    number of chances in 36 tries that the player has of collecting the resource. So, drop your Settlements
                    in the intersection with the most total dots on the three adjacent hexes.<br><br> 

                    <b>Strategy 3 - Luck:</b> Catan although a game of strategy is also a game that involves a lot of luck. The following table displays
                    the most likely dice rolls. Therefore, one strategy would be to place your settlements on the tiles that have
                    the highest possibility of being rolled. However, beware that the most popular numbers rolled are high targets
                    for robbers!<br><br>
