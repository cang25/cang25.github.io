                <p>Hi! My name is Christine and I am a first year student at Seneca College majoring in Computer Programming and Analysis. For this project, I chose to research one of my favorite board games - Catan. I learned alot while researching its history and the significant figures in it. I hope this web page will act as a good introduction to future Catan lovers!</p><br><br>
